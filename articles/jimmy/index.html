<p>
    Jimmy is a bit of the cultural genome of Truveris. The name
    and concept was original sourced from a stackoverflow
    question which was then deleted (but is <a href="https://blog.codinghorror.com/new-programming-jargon/">now preserved on the Coding Horror blog</a>). Since then,
    Jimmy-proofing has become a way of thinking and a kind of
    mantra.
</p>

<p>
    We also did what any reasonable software team would do:
    bring Jimmy to life. And thus, Jimmy the clueless markov
    chain bot was born.
</p>

<p>
    And he's got a face, of course:
</p>

<p>
    <img title="jimmy, shamelessly stolen from the link above" src="jimmy.png" style="width: 117px" />
</p>

<p>
    As the prototypical clueless developer, Jimmy has just
    graduated from college and is ready to refactor your
    systems ever so carefully. The havoc that Jimmy can wreak
    is not to be understated. Awful code is a technical debt
    that will have to be paid down with a rewrite. Jimmy is
    inventing new abstractions (think Jackson Pollock style),
    writing code using only side effects, and passing new and
    exotic arguments to functions. Jimmy-proofing your system
    is an attempt to prevent all of these from happening.
</p>

<h3>You Are Jimmy</h3>

<p>
    "I am become Jimmy, the destroyer of codes" as it was
    written in the Baghavad Gita. In some ways and at some
    times, we were, are, and will be Jimmy. Jimmy exists to
    remind us of the consequences of our well intended but
    possibly ill informed programming decisions. Jimmy is the
    chaos monkey of your codebase. The code I wrote many years
    ago had many problems. It always does. And years from now,
    you will be trying to modify that code. Or repurpose it
    slightly. And if you Jimmy-proofed your code, you will be
    grateful.
</p>

<h3>What is Jimmy-proofing?</h3>

<p>
    The most important aspects of Jimmy-proofing are failing
    fast, being explicit, and testing.
</p>

<p>
    I often see statements of the form:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">message = None
    if state == constants.STATUS_PENDING:
        message = "PENNED IN"
    elif state == constants.STATUS_RUNNING:
        message = "RUN IN WITH THE LAW"

return message</code></pre>

<p>
    That missing else drives me nuts. And it points at two
    things: failing fast and being explicit. What if this
    function isn't supposed to handle any other states and is
    simply relying on the caller to verify it is doing the
    right thing? What if it is supposed to (possibly even
    documented that way) but doesn't? What if it's just a
    thinko? All of these questions can addressed with some good
    ol' fashioned explicit failure (or maybe not failure). If
    that if block had ended:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">else:
    raise Exception("Unhandled state {}".format(repr(state)))</code></pre>

<p>
    You would know that only those two states are allowed.
    Maybe Jimmy just passed the wrong value. Maybe he added a
    new state and forgot to address this location. But now we
    have Jimmy-proofed this function because (hopefully) it
    will fail in development or testing.
</p>

<p>
    On the other hand, maybe this function can be called safely
    without needing to be one of those two states. You should
    write:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">else:
    pass</code></pre>

<p>
    This will explicitly state that you know this block can
    handle arbitrary values. It will upset your coverage
    checker, but add the appropriate pragma and you'll live.
</p>

<p>
    What about testing you ask? Testing is essential for two
    reasons. The first is that the above example fails during
    testing instead of during a live news demo of your
    application. The other is that testing encourages the
    construction of testable abstractions. Testable
    abstractions tend to be distinct, modular blocks of code.
    Just what we're looking for and just what we're trying to
    prevent jimmy from not creating. You should have reasonably
    good test coverage and run your tears frequently and as a
    part of your build process. This keeps Jimmy (remember, you
    are Jimmy. I am Jimmy. We are all Jimmy) out of production
    and behind our desks.
</p>

<h3>So tell me about the bot</h3>

<p>
    The part you've been dying to hear and I've been living to
    write. Jimmy was a markov chain bot based on Hailo that was
    trained on our chat server logs. He had a life of his own.
    A personality. A guru. A sage. A master of wise sayings.
    Sometimes spewing gibberish. Jimmy would frequently offer
    advice, troll other bots, learn foul language, and insult
    his creator. He was also an important outlet. When someone
    wanted to say something funny, or sarcastic, or air a
    complaint, they would say it to Jimmy. Jimmy was a kind of
    collective catharsis and a safe outlet. Because emotion in
    written speech is often hard to detect, Jimmy served as a
    proxy &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag. This allowed frustrations to be vented
    without actually calling out anyone directly and allowing
    the problem to be made open.
</p>

<p>
    Jimmy was decommissioned when we moved to mattermost for a
    few reasons. But his spirit still lives on. He is still
    addressed directly and most people still understand what
    that means.
</p>

<p>
    I said earlier that we are all Jimmy. In the programmer
    sense, we have all written shitty code. In the bot sense,
    all of our chatter contributed to his personality. We are
    all Jimmy. Let that keep us humble.
</p>

<p class="small">
    P.S. Jimmy is coming back! The details of that, however,
    will be the subject of another blog post.
