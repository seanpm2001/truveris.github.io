<p>
    In my search for a scalable, session based, highly configurable load testing
    tool, I happened upon Locust.  I was looking for something between the 
    lightweight but pure throughput testing of
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/programs/ab.html">ab</a> and full
    on virtual machine scripted browser transactions.  Locust seemed to fit the
    bill, and so far has done everything I have needed, both for
    quasi-functional testing as well as benchmarking API endpoints.  A great
    departure from the normal heavyweight
    <a href="http://grinder.sourceforge.net/">The Grinder</a>, Locust provided a
    lightweight, yet totally functional approach to user emulation testing.
</p>

<p>
    <a href="http://locust.io/">Locust</a> is a lightweight
    framework designed to allow script-able application interactions to be
    scripted simulating the burstiness of an end user.  Once the base set of
    tasks is defined, locust allows it to be scaled out to an arbitrary number
    of users, all acting independently with their own session data.  Locust
    also makes running in a distributed master/worker fashion simple with a few
    configuration tweaks.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">Installation</h2>

<p>
    Installing locust is absurdly simple, in a virtual env, <code>pip install
    locustio</code>.  Pip will pull in all the requirements and you are off to
    the races.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">Getting Started</h2>
<p>
    Locust is fairly straight forward to use; import the needed classes, write
    a HttpLocust class and at least one task, then run your project with
    <code>locust -f <yourfile.py></code>.  This will launch your task definitions as
    well as Locust's internal flask engine for controlling the test and
    displaying both the live results and providing access to csv downloads.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>See the example components below:</strong>
</p>

<p>HttpLocust class:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">class WebsiteUser(HttpLocust):
    host = "https://api.example.com"
    task_set = WebsiteTasks
    min_wait = 1000 # time in ms
    max_wait = 15000 # time in ms</code></pre>

<p>
    The above declares a new class that will inherit the HttpLocust, which
    fulfils one of the two requirements of locust: your file must be valid
    python, and must have at least one class that inherits from
    <code>Locust</code>.  The HttpLocust class includes some additional helpers
    to simplify http requests and session management.  In our example class we
    define the target host that all the request URLs will be built from, the
    TaskSet class we want this Locust to execute, and the delay window we want
    each task to be executed in.  As Locust tries to emulate user behavior, it
    will pause each individual <code>'User'</code> between <code>min_wait</code>
    and <code>max_wait</code> ms, to simulate the time between normal user actions.
</p>

<p>
    Each of these HttpLocust classes will keep track of the web clients state,
    including cookies, to better emulate an end-user's browser.
</p>

<p>
    After getting the session class, we need to define some tasks and their
    <code>TaskSet</code>:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class WebsiteTasks(TaskSet):
    @task(10)
    def index(self):
        self.client.get("/")

    @task(5)
    def about(self):
        self.client.get("/about")

    @task(1)
    def contact_us(self):
        self.client.post("/contact_us", {
            "email": "customer@example.com",
            "subject": "Sales inquiry",
            "message": "I am very interested in your product...",
        })</code></pre>

<p>
    The above defines three separate tasks <code>index</code>,
    <code>about</code>, and <code>contact_us</code>, which perform a GET on /
    and /about, and a POST to /contact_us, respectively.  In
    <code>contact_us</code>, the POST data is built from the dictionary passed
    as the second argument.  Each of these tasks will be executed in a random
    order, with a delay of min_wait..max_wait between the beginning of each
    task.  The decorator task performs the magic needed for the following
    function to be executed by locust as a discrete task.
</p>

<p>
    The integer passed to <code>@task()</code> is the weight of the task.  In
    this case, we have a weight of 10 for <code>index</code>, 5 for
    <code>about</code>, and 1 for <code>contact_us</code>, thus
    <code>index</code> will get executed 10x more often than
    <code>contact_us</code>,
    and twice as often as <code>about</code>.  You can easily see how locust will
    distribute requests by running <code>locust -f <yourfile.py> --show-task-ratio</code>
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>

<pre class="language-raw"><code class="language-raw">Task ratio per locust class
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
100.0      WebsiteUser
62.5       index
31.2       about
6.2        contact_us

Total task ratio
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
100.0      WebsiteUser
62.5       index
31.2       about
6.2        contact_us</code></pre>

<p>
    Note that while each of these example functions only has a single
    <code>self.client</code> call, you can perform multiple requests in each task.  This
    allows for proper setup of a form, such as grabbing the token out of a
    hidden form field for inclusion in the <code>client.post</code> call you actually
    want to test.
</p>

<p>
    Now that we have a few basic tasks defined and configured, we can run
    locust directly, using ``locust -f locust_example.py``.  This will launch
    locust with our definition file, as well as start a web interface on
    localhost:8089.  After connecting to http://localhost:8089/ you will be
    presented with the following prompt:
</p>

<a href="locust_launch.jpg" class="image-link">
    <img src="locust_launch.jpg" alt="Locust Launch">
</a>

<p>
    Here we specify how many total users we would like, and the rate at which
    to spawn them.  The rate is user specified to avoid situations where 100
    sudden new users would cause issues with caching/scaling/etc.  Once you
    click start swarming, Locust will begin running your <code>HttpLocust</code> users,
    spawning them at the hatch rate, up until reaching the number specified for
    total users.
</p>

<p>
    Once the hatch rate is reached you will be presented with a display of the
    current status, showing each task that has been run and its various
    statistics.  This display will be updated periodically while the tests run.
</p>

<a href="locust_dashboard.jpg" alt="Locust Dashboard" class="image-link">
    <img src="locust_dashboard.jpg" alt="Locust Dashboard">
</a>

<p>
    Once all required user sessions have spawned and completed their startup
    tasks, Locust conveniently restarts statistic collection to get an accurate
    picture of the desired load.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">One Step Further</h2>

<p>
    Since the file is written in python, you can have any number of functions
    that are not wrapped with a @task that you can call from within tasks.  For
    instance to test our auto-complete suggestion API, I load a word list as a
    global dictionary from disk, then in any auto-complete request I grab a
    random word, return a chunk of the word from the third character to a
    random position > 3 and use that as the GET parameter.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Example:</strong>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">import random
with open('words.txt', 'r') as temp_file:
    words = [line.rstrip('\n') for line in temp_file]

@task()
def search(self):
    word = words[random.randint(0,len(words)-1)]
    length = random.randint(3,len(word))
    self.client.get("/search?search=%s" % word[0:length], name="/search?search=[string]")</code></pre>

<p>
    In this example, we are substituting the word with the requested length in
    the query string, and then via the name kwarg we are telling locust how to
    group requests.  As this method will generate a large number of unique
    requests (by design) I don't want the output polluted by 1000s of requests
    for <code>/search?search=a</code>, <code>/search?search=b</code>, etc.  By using the name
    kwarg, all requests by this get will be grouped under the entry
    <code>/search/?search=[string]</code>, with aggregated statistics for all the
    queries.  This works in this situation, as ideally each search result
    should be similar and we don't care about the specifics.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">Just Keep Stepping</h2>

<p>
    Since the HttpLocust class is instantiated in each emulated user thread, we
    can do certain house keeping tasks in a TaskSet and have those brought
    along with the user.  The most obviously useful gain from this, outside of
    cookie based session continuity, is the ability to run a specific task on
    start.  This task is ensured to run prior to any others, making it
    essential for any log-in or session initialization steps needed.  By
    defining an <code>on_start</code> function, it will be run automatically at the
    initialization of the task set.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>on_start example:</strong>
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">class WebsiteTasks(TaskSet):
def on_start(self):
    self.client.post("/user/signin", {
        "email": "dllama@example.com",
        "password": "what!thatsmypasswordtoo",
    })</code></pre>

<p>
    This above snippet will ensure that any tasks run within the
    <code>WebsiteTasks</code> taskset will be logged in as <code>dllama@example.com</code>.  This
    session will be continued for the current worker, carrying cookies
    accumulated throughout the session for future requests.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">Caring about more than the HTTP status</h2>

<p>
    Locust also exposes a mechanism to ensure that not only is the application
    responding to responses on the HTTP level, but that the data returned is
    actually useful.  For requests that have an expected, consistent output,
    checking the returned value is relatively straight forward
</p>

<p>
    In this example, <code>/about</code> is requested, then scanned for the string
    "Founded", making the assumption that our about page will contain some
    information about when we were founded.  If the string is found, the
    response is marked successful.  If, however, the string is not located, we
    mark the response as failed and provide an error message.:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">@task
def about(self):
    with self.client.get("/about", catch_response=True) as response:
        if response.text.find("Founded") > 0: # Text is on the page
            response.success()
        else:
            response.failure("Founded not found in response")</code></pre>

<p>
    Although this is highly rudimentary and probably not the quickest, cleanest
    or sane way of doing simple testing like this, it will work for simple
    checks , as well as being easily expanded to checking shorter responses, 
    as in API responses.
</p>

<p>
    The response object exposes a number of ways to get at the response, such as
    returning a JSON object, the text, etc. Details can be found in the
    <a href="http://docs.locust.io/en/latest/api.html#response-class">Documentation</a>,
    but we will go over a few of the more obviously useful.
</p>

<p>
    The following examples will all assume the response object was returned in a
    task via <code>response = self.client.get("/contact_us")</code>.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Headers:</strong><br />
    Using <code>response.headers['Cache-Control']</code> will allow one to examine the
    caching policy the application has responded with for the results of the
    call and ensure cache policy compliance.  Similarly,
    <code>response.headers['Expires']</code> can be used to check the objects desired
    lifetime.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Cookies:</strong><br />
    <code>response.cookies</code> will return a dictionary of all cookies present in the
    response object.  Examples of use cases for this would be checking session
    cookies or checking for any custom cookies that should be set by your
    application.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Status Code:</strong><br />
    <code>responses.status_code</code> will allow you to take action depending on the
    current responses' status code.  For instance if the status is 401, you could
    fire a new request that will provide proper authentication.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">Closing</h2>

<p>
    So far this short writeup has demonstrated the basics of Locust; from
    defining tasks, to building a pseudo functional testing framework based on
    the response values.  The next article will cover some more advanced
    topics, like distributed mode testing, CSRF protected forms, and other topics
    yet to be realized.
