<p>ðŸŽ¶They roll down stairs and travel in pairs and over your devops dogðŸŽ¶</p>

<img alt="I swear this dog looks like our devops guy" title="I swear this dog looks like our devops guy" src="devops.jpg" />

<p>
    Well. Hopefully. Large numbers of software applications
    (including some of our own at work) don't log enough, log
    the wrong things, aren't actually logs, or don't end up
    anywhere useful. But what's a developer to do? How do we
    know when to log? Or what?
</p>

<p>
    Logs are pretty cheap. In a typical configuration, logs are
    collected locally where they are spooled before being sent
    to a collection point (or a collection of collection
    points). rsyslog is capable of efficiently handling
    thousands of records per second. It is also capable of
    filtering the logs based on arbitrary properties of the log
    record, including the message itself. In a network with
    sufficient throughput the network overhead associated with
    even verbose logging from a busy application is rarely a
    bottleneck. All of these factors combined mean that from an
    infrastructure standpoint we should be going wild with
    logs. Assuming your application can be easily configured by
    your administrator (or by yourself) you can safely log
    large volumes of information.
</p>

<p>
    At the application level, logging is often done
    synchronously. In Python (particularly the cPython
    implementation), there is no real threading and no
    opportunity to offload logs to a separate worker thread.
    While unfortunate, applications rarely suffer from
    performance issues here, especially when configured to send
    logs locally. It is safe to log frequently in this manner
    with little performance impact.
</p>

<p>
    More frequently performance issues can arise when
    attempting to log large amounts of information that involve
    a side effect. For example, an application loads some
    information from the database and logs it. If the logging
    process causes additional information to be loaded from the
    database, this can be problematic especially when iterating
    over a large collection and performing a load at each step.
    If your application is typically long running, slowdowns
    like this can go unnoticed. Caution must be exercised when
    logging data that may have network, disk, or process
    related side effects.
</p>

<p>
    Even with the above caveats, you still probably aren't
    logging enough. In most cases, the performance issues
    encountered above are more acceptable than a complete lack
    of logging.
</p>

<h2>Not Logging Enough</h2>

<p>
    There are three aspects of not logging enough: information,
    context, and frequency.
</p>

<p>
    What information you should log is actually a lot more
    straightforward than most people realize. When you call a
    function and want to log that it is being called, some
    obvious information to log are the parameters passed to the
    function. You may, additionally, want to note the return
    value of the function or the fact that the function is
    returning. This pattern (ingress and egress logging) can
    also provide useful information in the form of timestamp
    deltas so you can see how long the function call took. You
    may also want to actually log the execution time itself.
    This sort of logging should generally be used for functions
    that are major entry points for your application or any
    function that has an extended running time (as a guideline,
    anything over a second or two is probably "extended").
</p>

<p>
    You should also strongly consider logging whenever your
    service makes a call to an external resource, regardless of
    the time taken. External resources like databases, files
    (yes, logging that you're going to open a file and where it
    is can be very helpful), APIs (even internal), and
    subprocess invocations all should be logged. And you should
    include as many of the parameters as you are able to when
    doing so. Return values as well (see my comments on timing
    above) are useful especially when the call is to a database
    service or API.
</p>

<p>
    Your logs need context. <code>"updated client"</code> is
    not a particularly useful message. Don't assume you'll be
    able to locate your log message based on a string like that
    (and don't log empty strings. Jimmy logs empty strings). If
    you updated a client, that client record probably has an
    identifier and a name. Include them! We use SQLAlchemy as
    our ORM and our base class that all other models inherit
    from include a <code>__repr__</code> that interpolates the
    class name and the primary key column values into the
    output. The Client model can override this to include the
    name.  SQLAlchemy also provides for an info attribute where
    you can stash any information you want. It's not a bad
    place to indicate extra fields you want interpolated into
    your <code>__repr__</code>. So the above message becomes
    <code>"updated client &lt;Client 1 'Jimmy, Inc.'&gt;"</code>.
</p>

<p>
    Of course, you probably want to include what it is you
    updated! SQLAlchemy's change events are great for this
    because they will allow to define once that you want to
    listen for attribute changes and then allow you to log them
    all. <code>"set attribute 'phone" on &lt;Client 1 'Jimmy, Inc.'&gt; to '999-999-9999' from '000-000-0000'"</code>
    can be automatically generated for every change. Pretty
    cool.
</p>

<p>
    What other context is there? In the information examples I
    gave, I typically also log the function name so I can tell
    where it is being called from. You can also use stack
    inspection techniques to locate the module, class,
    function, file, and line, but there can be an associated
    performance penalty associated with doing so. The example
    above for automatically logging attribute changes can
    suffer from a lack of context but can be corrected using
    this technique.
</p>

<p>
    Logging via syslog (and many other methods) also typically
    include other helpful context by default. Things like time
    and hostname are some examples. Software versions are also
    helpful, though you may want to log these just once at
    application start. If you're logging from a device and it
    has a physical location, you may want to include that
    location in your log records, especially if the device can
    move. Other aspects of the environment are natural targets
    for inclusion as well.
</p>

<p>
    We have many processes that log some information when they
    begin running. For processes running from cron, this serves
    as a kind of heartbeat. For web applications, logging when
    a request begins and returns can serve the same purpose,
    especially when a health check is being frequently executed
    on the service. Long running daemons that wait for work
    (for example, by selecting on a socket) should log after
    each select timeout. Just because your application's
    process is alive doesn't mean it is doing anything useful.
    Logging frequently can help diagnose problems when your
    application hangs or becomes deadlocked.
</p>

<h2>Record twice, log once, read over and over again</h2>

<p>
    Log records should be easily readable by humans. You aren't
    really doing anyone any favors by logging in XML, so please
    never, ever do that. JSON is also not a log format that you
    really want to read. If log in binary from Python, consider
    getting a job in a different field (obviously we all have
    constraints. I build server based applications in Python.
    Embedded devices in C might be a different story). Logs
    should read like a biography of your process' lifetime.
</p>

<p>
    But that doesn't mean we should create logs that can't be
    read by machines. Very often, we would like to mine
    information from logs, get statistics (we're all using some
    form of statistics collection, right?), and sometime just
    want grep to be useful. These considerations also require
    that our logs be readable by programs as well. Typical
    formats often include metadata and context in a structured
    manner. This is good. But we should also be mindful of the
    fact that our messages need some structure, too. When we
    log times, people like formats like "1 day, 3 hours, 46
    minutes, and 37.23 seconds". This is how people think about
    and communicate time. But searching for processes that ran
    longer than four hours with this format is less than ideal.
    You should also include the time in milliseconds so that
    you can easily extract and filter on that value from a
    program.
</p>

<h2>Identifying Logs</h2>

<img alt="yep, that's wood" title="yep, that's wood" src="https://3.bp.blogspot.com/_qqHbgA_Wy2s/TCR5fXLfcUI/AAAAAAAAAwc/t1mugJ6Mjo8/s1600/identifying-wood.jpg" />

<pre>print("updated client {}".format(repr(client)))</pre>

<p>
    Not a log. Don't do that. Especially if you are a module
    author. Your users will hate you.
</p>

<p><code>sys.stderr.write</code> is also not logging.</p>

<pre>with open("/tmp/derp.log", "a") as logfp:
    logfp.write("updated client {}".format(repr(client)))</pre>

<p>
    Still not logging. These approaches work in a pinch but are
    definitely not a structured approach.
</p>

<pre>logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)
logger.debug("updated client {}".format(repr(client)))</pre>

<p>
    Nailed it. This is how you log in most Python applications.
    And this is the method you should always use. You should
    also be loading your logging configuration using
    logging.fileConfig. Your sysadmin will love you. Using
    fileConfig allows complete control over your logs, their
    format, and how they're emitted to other locations. Unless
    you have special needs or are using an incompatible system
    (I'm looking at you, twisted) this is the method you WILL
    use.
</p>

<p>
    As an added bonus, the entire Python ecosystem logs this
    way. Modules can be instrumented with logging and with the
    appropriate configuration you can collect the logs from
    them as well. Want to see what SQLAlchemy is doing? How
    about requests? It's as simple as configuring your logging
    to collect from their loggers.
</p>

<h2>What level should we log at?</h2>

<p>
    debug is your go-to level. When in doubt, it's usually a
    safe choice. Most items mentioned above will be debug
    level. Some items like start events, quit events, and the
    execution of slow functions should log slightly higher at
    info. This affords your system administrator the ability to
    discard debug level logs if so desired without sacrificing
    important information regarding the application's current
    state (and you should let them make that decision. Log!)
    Warn should be used when the application encounters a state
    in which it can continue but that should be brought to the
    attention of someone. A condition such as an unexpectedly
    slow network call is worthy of a warning. Errors are
    anything that prevent the normal functioning of your
    application. If at all possible, your application should
    fail gracefully. But it should most certainly log the
    condition that resulted in the error. If you're executing a
    query and need to ensure some data is present before
    proceeding, that missing data should result in a log
    emitted at error level. Python also includes a
    logger.exception method. You should use this when you are
    handling an exception and want the stack trace
    automatically logged for you as well.
</p>

<h2>Now that we've got logs, what do we do with them?</h2>

<p>
    Send them to a collection server. rsyslog supports
    collecting logs locally, relaying logs, and also storing
    your logs somewhere useful. You can then take those logs
    and stash them in other tools, like the popular
    elasticsearch-logstash-kibana (ELK) stack. You can send
    them to a third party log collection and analysis service
    like loggly. You can configure rsyslog to email you errors.
    Just don't throw them away! There's a lot of valuable
    information in those logs that you may have never known
    that you needed, especially when your devops gets up at 3am
    and subsequently wants to kill you.
