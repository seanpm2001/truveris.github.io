<p>Inspired by a Google I/O talk, I decided to leverage some of Android's Data
    Binding capabilities when building out a new feature in our OneRx application.
    Result: I loved it.</p>
<h3>Android Data Binding</h3>
<p>Google I/O 2016 had a great talk on the latest features in Android Data Binding:
    <b><a href="https://events.google.com/io2016/schedule?filters=Android&sid=61d80842-c8f6-e511-a517-00155d5066d7#day2/61d80842-c8f6-e511-a517-00155d5066d7">Advanced Data Binding</a></b>.
    I highly recommend watching it. The summary is that it covered Data Binding
    features including two-way data binding, method references, and lambdas.
    These features let developers bind UI fields to data objects in layout files alone,
    without any code. Additionally methods and lambdas (simple functions) can be
    called from within the layout files as a result of user action (for example <code>onClick:</code>).</p>

<p>I know I'm not alone in the frustration of how much boilerplate / glue code there is in
    Android when writing UI classes. First you have to use findViewById to
    find the view, then set its state, then add a clickListener to handle its
    events. Then, if your model data changes, you have to update the view's state.</p>

<p>The promise of Data Binding is to minimize the amount of glue and boilerplate
    code. The I/O talk was compelling and convincing, so I decided to try out
    these ideas in a new feature I was writing for our
    <b><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onerx.android&hl=en">OneRx Android app</a></b>.</p>
<h3>The task at hand</h3>
<p>My task was to create a contextual menu that would be triggered by an action
    button click:</p>
<img class="small-image" src="context_menu.jpg" alt="Context Menu">
<p>The feature is simple. There are one or two views that appear as a popup, that
    track the "is favorite" state of the result drug and/or pharmacy. Whenever a user
    toggles the switch the "is favorite" state should toggle
    locally and call our API to set the new state on the server.</p>
<p>Our concern here is how to track the "is favorite" state, update the view to
    reflect the current state, and trigger the API call. For the sake of discussion
    let's simplify the problem and just concern ourselves with a single
    view (Add Medication).</p>
<h3>This is not the code you are looking for</h3>
<p>Let's try it the old way first. We need to link the model to the UI and
    handle the actions. We'll use a Fragment to control the view for our example.
    First let's make the layout file:
    <pre><code class="language-markup">
        &lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;utf-8&quot;?&gt;
        &lt;RelativeLayout
        xmlns:android=&quot;http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android&quot;
            android:layout_width=&quot;match_parent&quot;
            android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
            android:background=&quot;@drawable/white_with_blue_border&quot;&gt;
            &lt;Switch
                style=&quot;@style/Switch&quot;
                android:id=&quot;@+id/switch_favorite&quot;
                android:padding=&quot;@dimen/padding_regular&quot;
                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                android:layout_centerVertical=&quot;true&quot;
                android:layout_alignParentLeft=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;
            &lt;TextView
                android:id=&quot;@+id/label_title&quot;
                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                android:layout_centerInParent=&quot;true&quot;
                android:textColor=&quot;@color/blue&quot;
                android:textSize=&quot;@dimen/font_size_xlarge&quot;
                android:padding=&quot;@dimen/padding_regular&quot;
                android:text=&quot;Add Favorite&quot;/&gt;
            &lt;ImageView
                android:id=&quot;@+id/image_check&quot;
                android:layout_width=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                android:layout_height=&quot;wrap_content&quot;
                android:layout_centerVertical=&quot;true&quot;
                android:layout_alignParentRight=&quot;true&quot;
                android:padding=&quot;@dimen/padding_regular&quot;
                android:src=&quot;@drawable/context_icon_check&quot; /&gt;
        &lt;/RelativeLayout&gt;
    </code></pre>
    That gives us our view:</p>
<img class="small-image" src="view.jpg" alt="Favorite Item View">
<p>Then in our fragment, we have to inflate the layout and get references
    so all the subviews, and set listeners on the view and the switch.
    <pre><code class="language-java">
    public class TestFragment extends Fragment {

        @Nullable
        private Switch mSwitch;
        @Nullable
        private TextView mTitleLabel;
        @Nullable
        private ImageView mImageView;
        @NonNull
        // Could be injected or from intent or whatever.
        private FavoriteDrugModel mDrugModel;

        @Override
       public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
           View view = inflater.inflate(R.layout.context_menu_popup_menu, container, false);
           mSwitch = (Switch)view.findViewById(R.id.switch_favorite);
           // Handle switch changes to change the favorited state
           mSwitch.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener() {
               @Override
               public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton buttonView, boolean isChecked) {
                   setIsFavorite(isChecked);
               }
           });
           // Find the title label and image view so we can change their state on model state change.
           mTitleLabel = (TextView) view.findViewById(R.id.label_title);
           mImageView = (ImageView) view.findViewById(R.id.image_check);

           // Update UI to reflect current model state
           updateUI();
           return view;
       }
       ...
    </code></pre>
    So much glue code! We need an <code>updateUI</code> method too,
    to handle showing the right state:
    <pre><code class="language-java">
        private void updateUI() {
            if (mSwitch != null) {
                mSwitch.setChecked(mDrugModel.getIsFavorited());
            }
            if (mTitleLabel != null) {
                if (mDrugModel.getIsFavorited()) {
                    mTitleLabel.setTypeface(boldTypeFace);
                } else {
                    mTitleLabel.setTypeface(lightTypeFace);
                }
            }
            if (mImageView != null) {
                if (mDrugModel.getIsFavorited()) {
                    mImageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.context_icon_check);
                } else {
                    mImageView.setImageResource(R.drawable.context_icon_plus);
                }
            }
        }
    </code></pre>
    And then lastly we need to do the API call and handle the response. And,
    not forget to update the UI after we update the model state.</p>

<h3>An Elegant Weapon for a More Civilized Age</h3>
<p>Data-binding is our weapon against unneeded code. We can remove the glue code
    by providing the model object to the layout xml file. In xml we can use the
    model state to determine how the UI should look. As per the
    <b><a href="https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/index.html">Android developer documentation</a></b>,
    first the layout must be wrapped in a <code>&lt;layout&gt;</code> tag. Then,
    the data model can be provided to the layout via a <code>&lt;data&gt;&lt;variable&gt;</code> tag.

    The variable name is what we want to use in the layout file to reference it,
    and its type is the class it is.

    Note: If we wanted to set the view's visibility, or anything else that depends
    on an import, we can use <code>&lt;import&gt;</code> to access it.
    E.g.<code>&lt;import type=&quot;android.view.View&quot;/&gt;</code></p>

<p>To use data binding on a view, all we need to do is use <code>"@{}"</code>.
    So, inside our RelativeLayout, our background can be set based on the isFavorited state:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">android:background="@{favoriteDrug.isFavorited ? @drawable/white_with_blue_border : @drawable/unselected_blue_with_border}"></code></pre>
<p>
Inside the TextView, it's font is set based on the isFavorited state also:
</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">android:src="@{favoriteDrug.isFavorited ? @drawable/context_icon_check : @drawable/context_icon_plus}"</code></pre>
<p>The real magic is the <italic>two-way</italic> binding we can do on the
    switch. Instead of just making the switch state reflect the model state,
    we can make the model state change if the switch state changes. Two-way binding
    is accomplished simply by replacing <code>"@{}"</code> with <code>"@={}"</code>.

    The switch in our layout therefore looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">android:checked="@={favoriteDrug.isFavorited}"</code></pre>

<p>We can now update our fragment code to use the binding. You can see the other
    wonderful side-effect of binding is not needing to use findViewById nor needing
    to cast.
    We can also completely remove our <code>updateUI</code> method. Any change to the model
    will automatically update the layout.
    The class now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">
    public class TestFragment extends Fragment {

        // Could be injected or from intent or whatever.
        private FavoriteDrugModel mDrugModel;

        @Override
        public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            ContextMenuFavoritableItemBinding binding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater, R.layout.context_menu_popup_menu, container, false);

            View view = binding.getRoot();
            Switch mSwitch = binding.switchFavorite;
            // Handle switch changes to change the favorited state
            mSwitch.setOnCheckedChangeListener(new CompoundButton.OnCheckedChangeListener() {
                @Override
                public void onCheckedChanged(CompoundButton buttonView, boolean isChecked) {
                    setIsFavorite(isChecked);
                }
            });

            return view;
        }

        private void setIsFavorite(boolean isFavorite) {
            // Here we would do the API call here and get the response. Just pretend.
            boolean newFavoriteState = isFavorite;
            mDrugModel.setIsFavorited(newFavoriteState);
        }
    }
</pre></code>

<p>Isn't that much better?

    As you can see a DataBinding class is automatically created from our layout
    definition, which provides a setter for our favoriteDrug object, and
    also getters for all the views in the layout (based on their ids).
    <code>binding.getRoot()</code> returns the root view of the layout.

    For now, we still need the onCheckedChangeListener to be set, because
    although changing the switch checked state will update our model, it won't
    trigger the API call.</p>

<p>There was one surprise for me, which was that if I toggled the
    switch in my UI, the model state would change, but the other UI elements
    that were also bound to that model, would not change. In order to make
    all bound UI elements refresh, I had to update my model slightly.
    Calling <code>notifyPropertyChanged</code> ensures all the bound UI elements
    would refresh.</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">
    public class FavoriteDrugModel extends BaseObservable
    ...
    public void setIsFavorited(boolean isFavorited) {
        mIsFavorited = isFavorited;
        // Need to notify property changed because multiple UI actions can
        // cause the state to change, not just a single element.
        notifyPropertyChanged(BR.isFavorited);
    }
</code></pre>
<h3>Is that all?</h3>
<p>We can do still better. Instead of having to set the change listener
    for the switch, and call our method there, we can set the method to call
    inside our layout xml file. We do have to be careful not to insert business
    logic into our layout. The layout should only concern itself with UI. But,
    there's no reason we need the glue code if we can just set the checkedChanged
    handling in the layout.

    By providing our class as another variable into the layout, we can call methods
    on it, either by method reference or by lambda. I like the lamdba mechanism
    since it lets me provide whatever parameters I want to the method.

    We update our switch element in the xml like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">android:onCheckedChanged="@{()->presenter.switchChanged(!favoriteDrug.isFavorited)}"</code></pre>

<p>Now our fragment code is much better. The view logic is declarative (inside the layout xml).
    The model is two-way data bound, and our API call would take care of the
    business logic outside of our fragment.
    <pre><code class="language-java">
        public class TestFragment extends Fragment {

        // Could be injected or from intent or whatever.
        private FavoriteDrugModel mDrugModel;

        @Override
        public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle savedInstanceState) {
            ContextMenuFavoritableItemBinding binding = DataBindingUtil.inflate(inflater, R.layout.context_menu_popup_menu, container, false);
            return binding.getRoot();
        }

        private void switchChanged(boolean newOnValue) {
            // Here we would do the API call here and get the response. Just pretend.
            boolean newFavoriteState = newOnValue;
            // Even though the model was updated before, set it here in case the API call fails.
            mDrugModel.setIsFavorited(newFavoriteState);
        }
    }
    </code></pre></p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>I'm pretty impressed with the amount of code I no longer need thanks to
    Android's Data Binding features. As long as you make sure you use it for
    what it is (moving glue code from view class to layout) and not try to do bad
    things with it (triggering API calls from within your layout), it's a good tool.
    It's definitely something I'll continue to use moving forward for my views and layouts.</p>
