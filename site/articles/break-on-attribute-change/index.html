    Today I discovered a neat feature available in both Firefox and Chrome: break
    on attribute change. This allows us to break when some code changes a DOM element attribute.
</p>

<p>
    I was debugging an issue where some code involved with adding and removing
    styles for error indication on a table was incorrectly doing the following:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">$("td").each(function() {
    if (!$(this).hasClass("qc-error")) {
        $(this.parentNode).attr("style", "");
    } else {
        $(this.parentNode).attr("style", "border: 1px solid #f00; background: #eee");
    }
});</code></pre>

<p>
    The templating code was responsible for the initial hiding of the row and would
    insert this style when rendered:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-mako">&lt;tr id="second-fee-row" ${"{"}{'style="display: none"' if bid.fee_type != constants.FEE_TYPE_PER else '' | n}&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
    Additionally, some code elsewhere on the page was also attempting to manage
    this row by setting the display in response to changes in a dropdown:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">if ($("#fee-type").val() !== constants.FEE_TYPE_PER) {
    $("#second-fee-row").css("display", "none");
} else {
    $("#second-fee-row").css("display", "table-row");
}</code></pre>

<p>
    After first verifying that Firefox thought it should display the element, I
    looked at the page source. Checked out. <code>display: none</code> was definitely
    there.
</p>

<p>
    Then I spent some time looking for modifications to <code>#second-fee-row</code>. I
    inspected all the sites that were modifying that row (by looking for that id).
    Nope. Nothing setting the style to empty.
</p>

<p>
    After a quick google to confirm that <code>display: none</code> hadn't suddenly become
    unsupported, I came across this Stack Overflow link:
    <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13303650/break-when-style-has-changed-in-chrome-dev-tools">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/13303650/break-when-style-has-changed-in-chrome-dev-tools</a>.
    This in turn led me to search for the same feature in Firefox (my day-to-day
    browser) which resulted in: <a href="https://getfirebug.com/doc/breakpoints/demo.html">https://getfirebug.com/doc/breakpoints/demo.html</a>.
</p>

<p>
    I went ahead and set such a breakpoint on the afflicted element. Lo and behold,
    the offending code was found and repaired with:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-javascript">$("td").each(function() {
    if (!$(this).hasClass("qc-error")) {
        $(this.parentNode).css({
            border: null,
            background: null
        });
    } else {
        $(this.parentNode).css({
            border: "1px solid #f00",
            background: "#eee"
        });
    }
});</code></pre>

<p>
    Not a perfect solution (should probably track the original value instead) but
    acceptable in this case.
