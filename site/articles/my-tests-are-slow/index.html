<p>
    The other day a coworker was remarking that their test suite ran much more
    slowly than mine. Much more slowly than the build server, too. And by the other
    day I mean the other day, last month, and probably a few other times.
</p>

<h3>Some Background On How We Test</h3>

<p>
    All of our test suites start out by initializing the database model. This includes,
    among other things, emptying the test database and creating all new tables,
    procedures, views, etc. using sqlalchemy's model system.
</p>

<p>
    Our core system includes hundreds of database objects. Our core products are
    supported by a single model library containing all the models for all of our
    projects.
</p>

<p>
    Constructing all of these objects is not a big problem. They load relatively
    quickly. And in production the schema isn't being constantly modified.
</p>

<p>
    After creating all of these tables all tests run on these tables and each test
    is responsible for ensuring the state in the tables it may be testing against
    is what it expects, including cleaning up the tables beforehand and adding any
    initial objects it needs.
</p>

<p>
    Tests then proceed to call whatever functions (or web endpoints, or whatever)
    and returns are inspected for correctness. Too, the database state is inspected
    to check for any side effects.
</p>

<h3>Hysterical Raisins</h3>

<p>
    Since I've been using the same development sandbox for a long time (and for a
    lot more than just development) my configuration has "evolved" (or degraded,
    depending on your perspective) over time.
</p>

<p>
    One aspect that had seen numerous modifications was my PostgreSQL
    configuration. Over the years, I have tweaked and tuned the config here in
    order to speed up my own queries or to test optimizations that would ultimately
    end up in production or staging.
</p>

<p>
    The result of this was that I had inadvertently made my tests run quickly! Even
    though my sandbox (we use virtualbox running on osx with ubuntu for our
    local development systems) had fewer allocated resources in terms of CPU and
    memory, careful optimizations had allowed it to run my tests significantly
    faster.
</p>

<h3>The Config</h3>

<p>
    Here's a rundown of what the relevant configuration options were:
</p>

<pre>shared_buffers = 1GB                    # min 128kB
work_mem = 32MB                         # min 64kB
maintenance_work_mem = 256MB            # min 1MB
wal_level = minimal                     # minimal, archive, or hot_standby
fsync = off                             # turns forced synchronization on or off
synchronous_commit = off                # synchronization level; on, off, or local
full_page_writes = off                  # recover from partial page writes</pre>

<p>
    <b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-SHARED-BUFFERS">shared_buffers</a></b>: This
    is the amount of data that PostgreSQL will store in its own
    shared memory. This primarily contains cached data. Keeping
    more data in cache generally speeds up all workloads, even
    fairly write heavy ones.

    <br/><b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-WORK-MEM">work_mem</a></b>: This
    is the amount of memory that PostgreSQL will use to execute a
    query. If a dataset can be loaded into memory and operated on
    in this much memory, it will. For example, a quicksort can run
    in memory, but all the data must be in memory. If the data fits
    in memory, it will be loaded in memory and sorted there.
    Otherwise, an on-disk merge sort may be performed.

    <br/><b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-resource.html#GUC-MAINTENANCE-WORK-MEM">maintenance_work_mem</a></b>: This
    is similar to the above configuration parameter, but for
    maintenance type operations such as CREATE INDEX.

    <br/><b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-WAL-LEVEL">wal_level</a></b>: This
    determines how much information is written to the write ahead
    log (WAL). Since we aren't making backups or performing
    replication on our sandboxes, mininal is the best choice for
    this.

    <br/><b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FSYNC">fsync</a></b>: This
    parameter ensures that data is written to disk to prevent
    corruption in the event of a crash. YOU SHOULD ONLY SET THIS TO
    "off" IF YOU ACCEPT THE RISK OF CORRUPTION. Since our sandboxes
    can be recreated from scratch fairly easily, using this is
    safe.

    <br/><b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-SYNCHRONOUS-COMMIT">synchronous_commit</a></b>: This
    parameter allows for certainty that a transaction was completed
    and written to disk. When "off", a transaction may report as
    committed but still may be lost in the event of a crash.

    <br/><b><a href="https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-FULL-PAGE-WRITES">full_page_writes</a></b>: This
    parameter controls whether or not a full page is written to WAL
    after a checkpoint. Not writing the page is a performance
    improvement but can result in silent, unrecoverable corruption
    in the event of a system failure.
</p>

<h3>But What About That Build Server?</h3>

<p>
    The build server had benefited from sharing parts of our production config as
    well as having its data directory mounted on a ramdisk. Both of these helped
    the build server cruise along where my coworker's development sandbox crawled.
</p>

<h3>How We'll Avoid This In The Future</h3>

<p>
    The above will be the settings recommended in our sandbox setup guide as well
    as in the vagrant setup script.
