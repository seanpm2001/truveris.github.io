    PyCon 2016 was held in Portland, Oregon at the end of May. I was one of
    the lucky 3000 or so Python developers able to attend. During the three day
    conference I listened to a total of 22 talks. I wanted to share something I
    learned there and picked one of my favorite talks, Daniel Riti's talk on
    <b><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dY-SkuENZP8"> gracefully
    degrading service failures</a></b>.
</p>

<h3>Remote Calls and Service Failure</h3>

<p>
    The failure of networks and services our systems depend on
    is inevitable. How do we deal with these situations?
    Daniel focused on the following three techniques:
    <ul style="list-style: none"><li><b>1.</b> Retries</li>
    <li><b>2.</b> Timeouts</li>
    <li><b>3.</b> Circuit Breaker Pattern</li></ul>

    I'm going to briefly introduce each one of them.
</p>

<h3>Timeouts</h3>

<p style="font-style: italic">
    "Your code can't just wait forever for a response that might never come, sooner
    or later, it needs to give up. Hope is not a design method."
    <span style="font-style: normal"> -Michael T. Nygard, Release It!</span>
</p>

<p>
    Let's assume we have a simple web app using Python's <b><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/requests/">requests</a></b> library to get the current time from a remote time
    service. Our function could look something like this:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
    def get_time():
        try:
            response = request.get('http://localhost:3001/time', timeout=3.0)
        except requests.exceptions.Timeout:
            return 'Time not available'
        return response.json().get('datetime')
</code></pre>

<p>
    If the time service is in unhealthy state, timeout forces an error in a given time.
    In this case, we will give up after a three second wait. Timeouts are
    extremely easy to use, since all you need to do is add an optional timeout
    parameter to your request; however, timeout is still applying load to the
    unhealthy service. Also, setting a timeout too short may mean we never
    get the response from otherwise healthy service, or in the opposite case keep
    user waiting without any kind of feedback for too long.
</p>

<h3>Retries</h3>

<p>
    Retry is pretty self explanatory: "If at first you don't succeed, attempt the
    operation again". Since one request can have a multiplicative effect on a
    system, it's important to evaluate if the benefit of obtaining a response from
    a server outweighs potentially increasing load on the service.

    If you decide to proceed with retries, then always limit the number of retries.
    It's also a good practice to introduce a delay between retry attempts.

    There's a wonderful library called <b>
    <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/retrying">retrying</a></b>
    that let's you set not only the number of retries, but a whole bunch of
    other parameters to the request. It's very simple to use:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
    from retrying import retry

    @retry(stop_max_attempt_number=3, wait_exponential_multiplier=1000,
            wait_jitter_max=500)
    def get_time():
        ...
        raise Exception
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>
    In the above example we set the total number of attemps to 3, introduce
    an exponentially growing delay between attempts and add a random jitter value
    from 0 to 500ms to the wait so that it further spreads out the requests and
    reduces the simultaneous load on the service.
</p>

<p>
    Let's return to the multiplicative effect for a moment. What this actually means
    is that if we have a system that has three layers above the database; backend,
    frontend and javascript and each of these layers are using retries configured
    to make 4 attempts, then in the worst scenario we end up making 64 attempts
    from a <b>single</b> user interaction (4 tries ^ 3 levels).
</p>


<h3>Circuit Breaker Pattern</h3>

<p>
    Circuit breaker pattern differs from the previous two methods in that it actually
    prevents operations when a depencency is unhealthy. It has three states: closed,
    half-open, and open:
</p>

<div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto">
    <img src="CBP.png" alt="Circuit Breaker Pattern"></img>
</div>

<p>
    Again, there's a great library, called <b><a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pybreaker">
    pybreaker</a></b> that allows you to set parameters like fail_max (=maximum
    number of failures allowed) and reset_timeout (=how long we want to wait before
    letting the exploratory request go through). A simple example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-python">
    time_breaker = pybreaker.CircuitBreaker(fail_max=2, reset_timeout=30)
    
    @time_breaker
    def get_time():
        ...
        raise pybreaker.CircuitBreakerError
        ...
</code></pre>

<p>The table below explains the pattern further:</p>

<div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto">
    <img src="CBP_table.png" alt="Circuit Breaker Pattern"></img>
</div>

<p>
    The first two requests go through ok, since the response time is under the
    timeout value of 3 seconds. The state of the circuit breaker pattern is closed.
    The third request takes 3s and fails due to the timeout; but, as we let it
    fail twice before triggering the circuit breaker pattern, the state of it is
    still closed. The next failing request reaches the max number of failures allowed
    and sets the circuit breaker pattern to open state.
    During the next 30 seconds all incoming requests are prevented.
</p>

<div style="width: 70%; margin: 0 auto">
    <img src="CBP_30s.png" alt="Circuit Breaker Pattern"></img>
</div>

<p>
    At the 30s mark, the state of the circuit breaker pattern is set to half-open
    and if the problem was fixed, like in our example, we allow the next request to
    go through for exploratory purposes. If it's successful, the state gets set to
    closed and requests are allowed to go through again. If the exploratory
    request failed, then another 30s wait would trigger.
</p>

<p>
    The circuit breaker pattern used together with timeouts offers a smooth user
    experience since users don't have to wait until the timeout triggers.
    This tool also reduces load on unhealthy services and prevents unhealthy
    service affecting the whole system.
</p>

<p>
    The advantages of this approach are obvious; however, it's important to pay
    attention to the parameters. A good approach is to monitor traffic and
    set parameters based on average response times.
