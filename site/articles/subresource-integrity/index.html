<p>
    Subresource Integrity (SRI for short) is a technique that
    allows you to ensure that your assets are being served
    unaltered. For example:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.slim.min.js"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<p>
    This is something you have probably seen fairly commonly.
    CDN, or content delivery network, served assets improve
    page load times by distributing the content from locations
    physically closer to the end user. They also allow you to
    offload the bandwidth and resposibility for actually
    serving your assets.
</p>

<p>
    But what happens when that third party is compromised? If
    all your site does is host cat gifs, it's probably not the
    end of the world. When you're dealing with sensitive
    information or accepting payments, however, a compromise
    could allow an attacker to steal valuable user information.
</p>

<p>
    SRI allows us to add a cryptographically secure hash to our
    tags so that we can indicate what the actual signature of
    our sources should be. That way, if an attacker compromises
    a third party displaying assets on your page, they will not
    be able to serve you malicious code (or other assets, as
    we'll see below):
</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.slim.min.js"
    integrity="sha384-uZ2OkdfFeYRaX81T8ZKlaMt5UJ7DkMwO8z95CYTpAtu9t6W7FaHvsa3xvalfNrnn"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</code></pre>

<h3>How Do I Generate That?</h3>

<p>
    There are a few ways to generate the hash itself. The
    "hash" is actually the base64-encoded representation of the
    binary digest of the resource. You could put together a
    simple shell pipeline:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">cat jquery-3.1.0.slim.min.js | openssl dgst -sha384 -binary | openssl enc -base64 -A</code></pre>

<p>
    But typing this over and over gets old quick. There's also
    <a href="https://srihash.org">https://srihash.org</a>,
    which will allow you to provide the URL of the resource and
    generate the hash for you.
</p>

<p>

    There's also my favorite method (shameless plug incoming):
    <a href="https://github.com/f0rk/srihash">https://github.com/f0rk/srihash</a>.
    srihash provides a simple command line tool to generate
    subresource integrity hashes from local files or remote
    urls:
</p>

<pre><code class="language-shell">~$ srihash https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.1.0.slim.min.js
sha384-uZ2OkdfFeYRaX81T8ZKlaMt5UJ7DkMwO8z95CYTpAtu9t6W7FaHvsa3xvalfNrnn</code></pre>

<h3>What Supports SRI?</h3>

<p>
    Two elements support SRI: <code>script</code> and
    <code>link</code>. Simply include the hash of the resource
    in the integrity attribute. If the script served varies
    (for example, different users see different scripts) you
    specify multiple whitespace separated hashes. If any hash
    matches, the resource will load.
</p>

<p>
    SRI is an experimental feature. At the moment, it is only
    supported by Chrome, Firefox, and Opera:
    <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity">http://caniuse.com/#feat=subresource-integrity</a>.
</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>
    SRI is one of many techniques to prevent the loading and
    execution of unexpected code. Other techniques, like
    content security policies, CORS and CORS attributes, and
    the meta referrer tag, should also be utilized as part of a
    scheme to make sure your data is protected.
