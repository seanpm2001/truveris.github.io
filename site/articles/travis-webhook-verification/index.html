<p>
    Travis CI allows users to configure <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Configuring-webhook-notifications">webhook notifications</a>
    which can be sent during certain build events.
    I recently played with this feature in order to send SMS messages via <a href="https://www.twilio.com/">Twilio</a> whenever a project failed to build/test.
    This post will discuss how to validate these webhook notifications to ensure that they are actually being sent by Travis CI.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">The Problem</h2>
<p>

    The app I built was able to handle incoming requests from Travis CI,
    but it had no way of checking where these requests were coming from. This meant that anyone could send a request to the app pretending to be Travis CI.
    <br>
    <br>
    The Travis CI's docs have a section on <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Verifying-Webhook-requests">verifying webhook requests</a>, 
    but the instructions (shown below) were a bit unclear for someone without a lot of knowledge in encryption/encoding. 
    <br>
    <br>
    1. Pick up the payload data from the HTTP request’s body.
    <br>
    2. Obtain the Signature header value, and base64-decode it.
    <br>
    3. Obtain the public key corresponding to the private key that signed the payload. 
    This is available at the /config endpoint’s config.notifications.webhook.public_key on the relevant API server. (e.g., https://api.travis-ci.org/config)
    <br>
    4. Verify the signature using the public key and SHA1 digest.
    <br>
    <br>
    The docs even give a few <a href="https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/#Examples">examples</a> on how to do this but none of 
    them pertain to JavaScript. I decided to figure it out for myself, and it ended up being pretty simple.
</p>

<h2 role="heading">The Solution</h2>

<p>
  There are many popular Node.js web frameworks and they each handle incoming requests in different ways. 
  This post will provide solutions with two of the most popular frameworks, <a href="https://expressjs.com/">Express</a> (v4.15.3) 
  and <a href="https://hapijs.com/">hapi</a> (v16.5.0). The logic can easily be ported to work with any framework.
  <br>
  <br>
  Both solutions will use the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/got">got</a> library to obtain Travis's public encryption key as well as 
  the built-in <a href="https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v6.x/docs/api/crypto.html">crypto</a> library for SHA-1 verification. 
  The Express solution will also require the <a href="https://github.com/expressjs/body-parser">body-parser</a> middleware.
  <br>
  <br>
  Note: The Node.js version being used at the time of this writing is v6.11.1 LTS.

<h3>Using Express</h3>
<p>
  Boilerplate Express code for creating a server can be found <a href="https://expressjs.com/en/starter/hello-world.html">here</a> or 
  you can reference <a href="https://github.com/Brodan/travis-webhook-verification-nodejs/blob/master/express.js">this</a> sample app. 
  The route should look as such:
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
    /* Imports and server config go here... */

    app.post('/travis', function (req, res) {
      let travisSignature = Buffer.from(req.headers.signature, 'base64');
      let payload = req.body.payload;
      let status = false;

      got('https://api.travis-ci.org/config', {
          timeout: 10000
      })
      .then(response => {
        let travisPublicKey =
          JSON.parse(response.body).config.notifications.webhook.public_key;
        let verifier = crypto.createVerify('sha1');
        verifier.update(payload);
        status = verifier.verify(travisPublicKey, travisSignature);
      })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log('Something went wrong:\n' + error)
      })
      .then(() => {
        if (status) {
          // Handle request here now that it has been verified...
        }
        res.sendStatus(200);
      });
    });
  </code></pre>
</p>

<h3>Using hapi</h3>
<p>
  Boilerplate hapi code for creating a server can be found <a href="https://hapijs.com/tutorials#creating-a-server">here</a> or 
  you can reference <a href="https://github.com/Brodan/travis-webhook-verification-nodejs/blob/master/hapi.js">this</a> sample app. 
  The route should look as such:
  <pre><code class="language-javascript">
    /* Imports and server config go here... */

    server.route({
      method: 'POST',
      path:'/travis',
      handler: function (request, reply) {
        let travisSignature = Buffer.from(request.headers.signature, 'base64');
        let payload = request.payload.payload;
        let status = false;
        
        got('https://api.travis-ci.org/config', {
          timeout: 10000
        })
        .then(response => {
          let travisPublicKey = JSON.parse(response.body).config.notifications.webhook.public_key;
          let verifier = crypto.createVerify('sha1');
          verifier.update(payload);
          status = verifier.verify(travisPublicKey, travisSignature);
        })
        .catch(error => {
          console.log('Something went wrong:\n' + error)
        })
        .then(() => {
          if (status) {
            // Handle request here now that it has been verified...
          }
          reply(200);
        });
      }
    });
  </code></pre>

  Ensure that the correct URL is being passed into the got request, as the .org and .com domains have different public encryption keys! 
  These URLs are https://api.travis-ci.org/config and https://api.travis-ci.com/config, respectively.
